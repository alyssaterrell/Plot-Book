- physical environemnt
  - climate 
  - topography
  - soils
- tree species (largest portion of book)
  - maps
  - stats and simple graphs on abundance, growth, mortality (by size)
  - architecture (e.g., allometries for height, biomass, sapwood,...)
  - leaf traits
  - age distribution from cores
  - climate sensitivity from cores ("quilt" showing multiple climate variables)
  - mortality rates through time & drivers of mortality
- biotic drivers of change (anthropogenic)
  - invasive plants
  - deer
  - invasive pests & pathogens
-abiotic drivers of change
  - increased amount of rain
  - sudden change in temperature (was 70° one week and then 30° the next)
